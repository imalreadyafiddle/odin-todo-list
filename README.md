"The concept of Object Role Stereotypes is discussed in the book Object Design: Roles, Responsibilies, and Collaborations by Rebecca Wirfs-Brock and Alan McKean. The book presents the following stereotypes::

Information holder – an object designed to know certain information and provide that information to other objects.
Structurer – an object that maintains relationships between objects and information about those relationships.
Service provider – an object that performs specific work and offers services to others on demand.
Controller – an object designed to make decisions and control a complex task.
Coordinator – an object that doesn’t make many decisions but, in a rote or mechanical way, delegates work to other objects.
Interfacer – an object that transforms information or requests between distinct parts of a system."
